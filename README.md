# AsteroidsCpp

Classic asteroids game made with C++ and SFML. On this project the BrightLib that I am developing gets a bit more complex by finally adding an entity class to share some code between the entities in the game. Keeping it simple and incrementing the complexity of the game and lib with every project.
