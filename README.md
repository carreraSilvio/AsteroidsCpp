# AsteroidsCpp

Classic Asteroids made in C++ with SFML. 

This is project 4 in a series of 10 projects I am making in C++. Along the way I am developing a framework/library of my own called BrightLib. 

BrightLib updates for this project:
- Adding an entity class to share some code between the entities in the game. Keeping it simple and incrementing the complexity of the game and lib with every project.
